Sometimes I like to keep 8tracks open on a second monitor but in such cases I prefer a clean view. Along the lines of [Nano](https://github.com/sdslabs/nano), here's Minimal 8tracks.

##Setup
Clone the repo, go to `chrome://extensions`, ensure developer mode is enabled, click on `Load unpacked extension` and select the cloned folder.

Now go to [8tracks](http://8tracks.com), select any playlist, click on the icon of Minimal 8tracks, enjoy.
